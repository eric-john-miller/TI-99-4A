# TI-99-4A
Various TI 99/4A programs in BASIC. 

The .TXT files contain Windows text versions of the source code.  
The files without extension are files in TIFILES format also known as XMODEM format. This is the native format for a file transferred from a TI to another machine via XMODEM, and includes a 128 byte header.  
 
Many of these are from COMPUTE!'s First Book of TI Games.

I will be exploring this code in future livestreams.
